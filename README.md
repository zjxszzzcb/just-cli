# 🛠️ JUST DO IT

**Stop memorizing. Just doing.**

Sick of Googling *"how to install X on XXX"* for the 47th time? Exhausted from remembering whether it's `systemctl` or `launchctl` or `net start`? Is it `apt-get update` or `brew upgrade` or `winget update`? Should you use `ifconfig`, `ipconfig`, or `ip addr`? 

just-cli was born from pure rage at context-switching between Linux, macOS, and Windows. One command to rule them all. No more "but it works on my machine" garbage. No more bookmark folders full of platform-specific cheat sheets.

Want to install something? `just install xxx`. Need to edit a file? `just edit xxx`. Expose your local service to the internet? `just tunnel xxx`. **That's it.** Go grab a coffee while your colleagues are still Googling and copy-pasting commands.

## 🔧 Development Guide

### Adding New Commands

JustTools is designed for extensibility. Adding a new command is simple:

#### Simple Command

1. Create a Python file in `src/just/commands/`
2. Register your command with the `@just_cli.command()` decorator
3. Done. The CLI auto-discovers and loads it.

Example:

```python
from just import just_cli, capture_exception, echo

@just_cli.command(name="mycommand", help="My custom command.")
@capture_exception
def my_command(arg: str):
    echo.success(f"Running with: {arg}")
```

#### Multiple Subcommands

For commands with multiple subcommands (like `just install cloudflare`), follow this pattern:

1. Create a directory under `src/just/commands/` (e.g., `mygroup/`)
2. Create `entry.py` to define the subcommand group:

```python
from just import create_typer_app, just_cli

mygroup_cli = create_typer_app(name="mygroup", help="My command group.")
just_cli.add_typer(mygroup_cli)
```

3. Create individual command files (e.g., `foo.py`):

```python
from just import capture_exception, echo
from .entry import mygroup_cli

@mygroup_cli.command(name="foo", help="Foo subcommand.")
@capture_exception
def foo_command():
    echo.success("Running foo!")
```

4. Usage: `just mygroup foo`


### Philosophy

The goal is simple: **abstract away platform differences**. Whether you're installing a package, deploying a service, or running a script, the command should be the same. `just install`, `just deploy`, `just run`. That's it.

### Environment Configuration

Uses `.env` for configuration management:

- `JUST_EDIT_USE_TOOL`: Editor preference (`textual` or `edit`)

## 📋 Dependencies

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether it's a new command, bug fix, or platform support, PRs are appreciated.

**Principle**: Keep commands simple and cross-platform. If a command only works on one OS, handle it gracefully with clear error messages.
